    <p>This birthday surprise was crafted with blood, sweat, and a LOT of shitty code. But I felt like it was worth trying as part of the gift.</p>

      <h2>Passing Pre-Calculus</h2>
      <p>I know math can be a bit stupid sometimes especially if you have the wrong teachers, which is why it‚Äôs become an obstacle for you on your path to pursuing CS. But this last summer, you were able to get past that stupid pre calc. And you did it all on your own for the most part! I only chimed in to help only like 2‚Äì3 times.  
      All that work you did to pass the class, that WAS YOU right there! And I‚Äôm proud of you for that, and I‚Äôll always be there if you ever need help with more math.</p>

      <h2>Getting The Job</h2>
      <p>I know how long you‚Äôve been wanting to have your very first job. You applied to a ton of different places just to not hear back from any of them. Which is stupid, because why the hell is the bar set so high for places like DAIRY QUEEN or even just a PET PLACE. It makes no darn sense. I think it‚Äôs stupid, you think it‚Äôs stupid, we all think it‚Äôs stupid. 
        But now finally you have a source of income for yourself as a student, and I‚Äôm really happy for you. I wish I could say the same for myself but yo boy‚Äôs unemployed, FOR NOW THAT IS! Congratulations on getting that job and making sure to spend that money wisely.  </p>

      <h2>Lifestyle Improvements</h2>
      <p> It‚Äôs pretty difficult for some people to make little changes in their lives for the better. But I think you did a really good job this past year and really took the initiative when it comes to improving your lifestyle. 
        You went out of your way to plan daily exercises, take notes of what you ate, and even tried fixing your sleeping schedule. All of which I find very commendable, so nice. I know that it can take a while for significant changes to happen and staying super consistent is also difficult, but you‚Äôre doing a great job so far just by taking that first step. Also that skincare really makes you pop! That last photo you sent me. An absolute masterpiece that I will always treasure in my album. Keep up the great work :3 </p>

<!-- BreakUp Section -->

    <div class="text-block">
      <h2>The Break Up</h2>
      <p> This one‚Äôs more for funsies than like a serious serious topic. I think we can both agree that our relationship hasn‚Äôt always been the best. A lot of fights, miscommunicating or lack of, and little to no changes in some departments. Maybe quite a few or a lot of those are a result of my own incompetence.. Koff Koff. The step you took to ending our relationship really did a number on me, and I think it was for the better. Made me really see what was wrong with everything, and if anything made me a bit of a better person. 
        Obviously I still have my many flaws, but at the very least, I‚Äôm more conscious or less ignorant of what I‚Äôm doing or saying. So thank you, for that and for reviving our relationship. I KNOW I SAID IT WASN‚ÄôT GONNA BE TOO SERIOUS BUT HERE I AM BEING ALL SAPPY AND STUFF. ALSO IT‚ÄôS PROBABLY GONNA BE WEIRD READING THIS AFTER THIS PAST WEEK WHERE WE BARELY INTERACTED AND IT SEEMS LIKE I KIND OF STARTED PULLING AWAY A BIT. 
        I AM VERY SORRY IN ADVANCE AS YOU ARE READING THIS. I‚ÄôLL EXPLAIN MORE UHH LATER IN THIS SITE. BUT YEAH GOOD JOB! </p>

    <h2>The End of the Site</h2>
    <p>We're almost at the end. Well we are at the end now. 
      In celebration of your 22nd birthday, I decided to be a little silly and create a video/edit for us. 
      I'm definitely going to cringe watching this, you might too. But at the very least I hope it also makes you smile or laugh a bit as well. 
      Enjoy the video!</p>

    <h2>Apologies</h2>
    <p class="last">So I owe you a bit of an explanation for why I've been so distant this past week. Honestly, I've just been really worried and anxious about getting your birthday celebration right.
      From trying to figure out how to code this site, to figuring out how to get you your physical gifts on time, to even just making the video. I think I just gave myself way too much to do 
      within such a short period of time and that just kind of fucked me over. I'm sorry that I gave off the vibe that I was depressed or upset about something. 
       You deserve the best and I hope I was able to give you some of that "best" with what I was able to do. 
    </p>

    <p>Love, your favorite monke üêí
