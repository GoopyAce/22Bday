    <p>This birthday surprise was crafted with blood, sweat, and a LOT of shitty code. But I felt like it was worth trying as part of the gift.</p>

      <h2>Passing Pre-Calculus</h2>
      <p>I know math hasn’t always been one of your strongest suits, which is why it’s become an obstacle for you on your path to pursuing CS. But this last summer, you were able to get past that stupid pre calc. And you did it all on your own for the most part! I only chimed in to help only like 2–3 times.  
      All that work you did to pass the class, that WAS YOU right there! And I’m proud of you for that, and I’ll always be there if you ever need help with more math.</p>

      <h2>Getting The Job</h2>
      <p>I know how long you’ve been wanting to have your very first job. You applied to a ton of different places just to not hear back from any of them. Which is stupid, because why the hell is the bar set so high for places like DAIRY QUEEN or even just a PET PLACE. It makes no darn sense. I think it’s stupid, you think it’s stupid, we all think it’s stupid. 
        But now finally you have a source of income for yourself as a student, and I’m really happy for you. I wish I could say the same for myself but yo boy’s unemployed, FOR NOW THAT IS! Congratulations on getting that job and making sure to spend that money wisely.  </p>

      <h2>Lifestyle Improvements</h2>
      <p> It’s pretty difficult for some people to make little changes in their lives for the better. But I think you did a really good job this past year and really took the initiative when it comes to improving your lifestyle. 
        You went out of your way to plan daily exercises, take notes of what you ate, and even tried fixing your sleeping schedule. All of which I find very commendable, so nice. I know that it can take a while for significant changes to happen and staying super consistent is also difficult, but you’re doing a great job so far just by taking that first step. Also that skincare really makes you pop! That last photo you sent me. An absolute masterpiece that I will always treasure in my album. :3 </p>

<!-- BreakUp Section -->

  <div class="container">
    <div class="text-block">
      <h2>The Break Up</h2>
      <p> This one’s more for funsies than like a serious serious topic. I think we can both agree that our relationship hasn’t always been the best. A lot of fights, miscommunicating or lack of, and little to no changes in some departments. Maybe quite a few or a lot of those are a result of my own incompetence.. Koff Koff. The step you took to ending our relationship really did a number on me, and I think it was for the better. Made me really see what was wrong with everything, and if anything made me a bit of a better person. 
        Obviously I still have my many flaws, but at the very least, I’m more conscious or less ignorant of what I’m doing or saying. So thank you, for that and for sort of reviving the relationship a bit. I KNOW I SAID IT WASN’T GONNA BE TOO SERIOUS BUT HERE I AM BEING ALL SAPPY AND STUFF. ALSO IT’S PROBABLY GONNA BE WEIRD READING THIS AFTER THIS PAST WEEK WHERE WE BARELY INTERACTED AND IT SEEMS LIKE I KIND OF STARTED PULLING AWAY A BIT. 
        I AM VERY SORRY IN ADVANCE AS YOU ARE READING THIS. I’LL EXPLAIN MORE UHH LATER IN THIS SITE. BUT YEAH GOOD JOB! </p>

    <p>We're almost at the end. Well we are at the end now. 
      In celebration of your 22nd birthday, I decided to be a little silly and create a video/edit for us. 
      I'm definitely going to cringe watching this, you might too. But at the very least I hope it also makes you smile or laugh a bit as well. 
      Enjoy the video!</p>
